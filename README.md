<h2>Databases</h2>

&emsp;About this Repo: For the Back-End part, I intend to create a Repo that will include various sketches, such as conceptual schemas, logical schemas, Modeling Redundancy Design (MRD), glossaries of terms, and data dictionaries. These will be implemented in both relational and non-relational databases, illustrating the process of creating a database from scratch to actual implementation. The databases I will develop can be visualized using dbdiagram.io, making them accessible to all users. I should also mention that this Repo is continuously evolving and will be updated periodically.
<br>&emsp;For each database Schema, you can take the txt file and input it into dbdiagram.io, where on the left side you will have the written details, and on the right side a visual representation of the database.
